        <div class="text"> 
            Liquid CD is in open alpha. It is currently on the Rinkeby testnet and only works with testnet tokens.  <br> <br>
            
            To begin, if you don't have it already, install Metamask. You can get it here. => <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en">Metamask</a>
            <br><br>
            
            You will need Rinkeby Ethereum for every transaction and to add liquidity. To get Rinkeby Ethereum please visit the public faucet => <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby Ethereum Faucet</a>.
            
            <br> <br>
            
            I have created a token for testing, LCD Token. The faucet can be found here => <a href="https://liquidcd.finance/faucet/">Liquid CD Faucet</a>. You can get a portion of tokens every 4 hours by using the faucet contract. <br> <br> 
            

            
            Once you have some tokens and some Rinkeby Ethereum head on over to the app and provide some liquidity. => <a href="https://liquidcd.finance/app/">Liquid CD App</a>
            
            <br><br>
            Please note that the frontend is buggy. If things don't seem to be working or numbers are showing 0, please refresh the page. 
            
            <br> <br>
            You are free to use an already created token or create one yourself for testing, any token will work as long as it is ERC20 complient. Once you have a coin you need to create a liquidity pool on uniswap and make the initial deposit to set the price. That can be done here => 
            <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f#writeContract">UniFactory Contract</a>. And then Here => <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool">UniSwap Pool</a>

        <div class= "title">What is Liquid CD?</div>
        <div class="text">A CD is described by Google as a certificate of deposit, a special type of savings account. You deposit your money into the account and agree not to make any withdrawals for a certain period of time. At the end of that time, you get your money plus whatever was earned in interest back. <br> <br> Liquid CD is very similar to a normal bank issued CD but the main difference is it runs on Ethereum and therefor is distributed and not centralized like a normal CD. On Liquid CD you can provide liquidity for any token/Eth combination. The Liquidity pools you are interacting with are hosted on Uniswap and your stake will still earn the fees associated with uniswap pools. <div class= "title">What's in it for me?</div> <br> The difference between adding liquidity on Liquid CD and providing it on Uniswap directly is the time lock. Once you add the liquidity to the pool a timer starts. You can cash out at any time but if you cash out early, just like a bank issued CD, you are penalized and lose some of your stake. Maturity is 30 days, for testing it's currently 2 hours. Any stake lost this way goes into a pool and is given out to anyone that brings their CD to maturity. Thats right, if you hold your Liquidity CD for 30 days you can cash in your CD and get a bonus out of the pool proportional to your stake vs the pools stake. <div class= "title">What's next?</div> <br> Sometime after the official launch I will release a governance token that will allow holders to change the maturity time and make other changes. Right now Liquid CD is only on Rinkey Testnet while I iron out any bugs in the smart contracts and work to make the frontend more efficient.
